# ShoppingCart

This is the code under test for ATA's ShoppingCart activity, an exercise for participants to create a test plan,
and to implement them as ~test methods that get called in a DIY test harness (based on a main() method)

This package contains the `ShoppingCart` class, which is the class under test, as well as traditional JUnit
automated tests to test the class's behavior.

(This package is not visible to the participants)

## See related Brazil packages

* ATACurriculum_ShoppingCart_Tests: where the starter test code lives, and where participants add their test cases and
  test methods.
* (Coming soon!) ATACurriculum_ShoppingCart_TestsSolution: where the 'solution' to the activity lives, with suggested
  tests methods that could be written.

## Delivering Javadoc

Participants do not have read access to the code for this package, so that they treat the `ShoppingCart` class as a
black-box API. They do have access to the Javadoc, which we make available via a ZIP file on workdocs. To update the
Javadoc:
1. `brazil-build`
1. Go to the relevant workdocs page (for V2Cohort1, for example, it is https://amazon.awsapps.com/workdocs/index.html#/document/e8c070e0d7d9f69efee105be104f7232683ff942cb911113c15187aae72fb2b2)
1. Upload the newly created ATACurriculum_ShoppingCart-javadoc.zip (located directly under .../[this package]/build/)
