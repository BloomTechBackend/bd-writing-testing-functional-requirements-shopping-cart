# Shopping Cart

## Repo

GitHub repo: [ebd-backend-1-shopping-cart](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/ebd-backend-1-shopping-cart)

## Intro
This activity is an exercise for participants to create a test plan,
and to implement them as test methods that get called in a DIY test harness (based on a main() method)

This package contains the `ShoppingCart` class, which is the class under test, as well as traditional JUnit
automated tests to test the class's behavior. **You may not modify the `ShoppingCart` class, or anything under the `src` directory!**

To learn about the `ShoppingCart` class, locate the javadocs folder, right click `index.html` and open in a browser.

## Instructions
You are to create at least three new test cases for the `ShoppingCartTest` class.
Open the `shopping_cart_test_cases.md` file under the `tst` directory for further instruction, and for example test cases.

## Running your tests
Type the command:

`./gradlew clean -q :test`

Into your terminal.
